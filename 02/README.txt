Assignment 2 - RSA Tunnel
=========================

Rathesan Iyadurai (10-107-688)

You should find the following files in this directory:

- README.txt
- rsa_server
- rsa_client
- app


Prerequisites
-------------

- Ruby >= 2.4


Usage
-----

1. Start the RSA server with

    ./rsa-server

2. Start the RSA client with

    ./rsa-client

3. Start one or more app clients with

    ./app

The app client allows you to send some mesages to the RSA server encrypted via
the rsa client via STDIN. I logged the encryption process in the client and
server output.
